                <h4>Biography</h4>
                <p align="justify">
                    My name is Rajwinder K Dhillon, I was born in Punjab, India. I moved to United States in 2012. I'm a student of BAS program in Renton Technical College. I'm a Personal Banker at KeyBank. I like to learn new things and that's why i'm taking computer science program and after this I'm thinking to get MBA in finance. I like the banking field more than computer science but computer science is helping me to understand our banking application software quicker, I'm helping my co-workers when software applications are not user friendly just because i have knowledge of software applications little bit more than them. In future I want to do something in Investments so MBA in finance will help me to grow.
